1. Proposed System (Overview)
1.1 Purpose
(IAAS) is a prototype web based application that provides Software Engineering students with
automated academic advisory by using an AI-powered chatbot and a visual degree progress
dashboard.
The primary purpose is to assist students in planning their selection of courses, offering
personalized recommendations using a large language model based chatbot. The system
addresses the need for more scalable and accessible advising by simulating the guidance an
academic advisor would provide.
This helps students make informed decisions about upcoming semesters and understand their
progress without the need of constant physical advisor meetings

1.2 Scope
The scope focuses on core functionalities. The system includes three main components: The first
component is an (LLM) driven chatbot that allows students to ask and receive recommendations
in natural language.The second component is a degree progress visualization interface that
displays the student’s completed and remaining degree requirements in a clear, understood
graphical format. The third component is Synthetic Data Management features to load and
process a pre-generated dataset of student records and course information.

1.3 Motivation
The motivation stems from critical challenges in current academic advising systems. Engineering
programs face a significant advisor-to-student ratio problem, with advisors handling 150-200
students each, limiting personalized guidance. Students frequently select courses that violate
prerequisites or delay graduation due to poor planning. Manual advising cannot scale to meet
increasing demand, and students often cannot get timely appointments during registration
periods. IAAS addresses these challenges by providing 24/7 accessible, personalized academic
guidance that helps students make informed course selections. The system targets undergraduate
Software Engineering students as primary users, with academic advisors as secondary
beneficiaries who can use the tool to help their advising process. By automating routine advising
sessions, the system frees advisors to focus on complex cases requiring human judgment.
1.4 Ethical Considerations and Disclaimer

IAAS is designed as an advisory tool to help, not replace, official academic advising. The system
provides recommendations that are advisory only and must be verified with academic advisors
before course registration. Users should be aware that the system may contain inherent biases
from training data or model limitations and does not account for all individual circumstances or
special cases. The system cannot consider personal factors such as work schedules, family
obligations, or learning preferences that might affect course selection. All recommendations
should be validated against official degree requirements and discussed with academic advisors.
The user interface displays a persistent banner stating: "IAAS recommendations are advisory
only. Please consult your academic advisor before finalizing course registration."

4. System Characteristics
4.1 User Interface
The user interface is designed to be simple and focused on two main features: the chatbot and the
degree progress view. The student dashboard has a clean simple layout with a navigation menu
or tabs for “chat advisor” and “Degree Progress”. In the chat advisor section the user sees a chat
window, a text input box, and a scrollable conversation, this interface feels familiar to many
users and resembles common messaging apps. The chatbot interface will use a clear font that
differentiates between the users question and the bots answer and perhaps to ensure readability.
In the degree progress section, The Interface presents a visual diagram or a structured list of
courses. Perhaps a flowchart or a roadmap of courses organized by semester or by prerequisite
structure. Completed courses could appear in green while unfinished or pending courses could
appear in red or gray colour. By hovering over a said course the user can see the details about the
course, title, credit hours, section, pre-requisites. The interface is responsive on various screen
sizes but optimized for desktop viewing
4.2 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation supports all user types. The Student User Manual provides a
guide with annotated screenshots explaining chatbot usage, sample queries for common
scenarios, interpretation of degree progress visualizations, and troubleshooting common issues.
The Administrator Guide offers a manual covering dataset preparation requirements, upload
procedures with validation rules, interpretation of validation reports, system configuration
options, and error resolution procedures. Technical documentation includes API reference with
all REST endpoints (admin endpoints protected), data schemas in JSON format, database entity
relationships, and integration guidelines. All documentation is available through the "Help"
menu.

4.3 Hardware Considerations
A standard development laptop or a small server can host the backend. Minimum recommended
server specs include a modern CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and about 10 GB of free storage space. This
is sufficient to run the web server and SQLite database. The LLM inference is cloud-hosted via
the OpenAI API. Students or admins need a device capable of running a modern web browser,
there is no need for specialized hardware on the client side, any typical desktop or laptop from
the last 5-7 years with an internet connection suffices.

4.4 Error Handling & Extreme Conditions
The system implements comprehensive error handling. When the OpenAI API quota ($20
monthly limit) reaches 90% consumption, the system automatically switches to rule-based
recommendations within 3 seconds, displaying a notification: "Approaching monthly AI budget
limit, switching to simplified recommendations. Full service resumes next billing cycle." This
ensures continuous service. API failures or timeouts also trigger the rule-based fallback with user
notification.
4.5 System Interface
The backend works as a web service built with a framework like FastAPI.The browser talks to
the backend using HTTP requests. For example, when a user types a question in the chatbot, the
browser sends it to an internal link, and the backend sends back the answer. These APIs are only
for the system’s own use, not public. IAAS uses a simple SQLite database to store synthetic
student, course, and enrollment data. The backend connects to this database through either ORM
code or direct SQL queries. When the admin uploads new data, the backend automatically runs

logic to insert all records into the database in bulk. The system connects to an LLM service that
powers the chatbot. It sends the student’s data and question to the AI model and receives a reply.
The project uses an online model, it calls an external API using an access key and internet
connection.
4.6 System Modifications
The system connects to an LLM service that powers the chatbot. It sends the student’s data and
question to the AI model and receives a reply. The current version includes only core features.
Future versions can add GPA forecasting, risk analysis, or real student data. The UI is simple but
expandable. New pages or tools can be added easily since the navigation and design are
consistent. Many settings come from files, not hard-coded values. If the curriculum changes, the
admin can upload a new dataset instead of editing the code.
4.7 Constraints
The project runs for two semesters (about 8–9 months). Only core features are built and tested.
Three student developers, OpenAI monthly budget. Built with open-source tools. It must run on
standard lab computers. Only synthetic data is used for privacy. The dataset models one program
and skips complex real-world cases. Used only in demos or evaluations.
4.8 Performance Characteristics
Chatbot and progress pages should load in under 3 seconds. Tests show the AI replies within 2
seconds. It handles up to 20 users at once without slowdown about 150 chatbot queries per
minute in total.The database lookups are indexed, and algorithms are lightweight. Even large
synthetic datasets for example 10k students, 500 courses can run easily. The system efficiently
uses little memory under 200 MB on average.
4.9 Quality Issues
Quality assurance for IAAS identifies potential risks and issues that could affect the quality of
the system, along with strategies to mitigate them. Course recommendations are tested against
degree rules to prevent wrong course advice. Synthetic data is reviewed and validated to prevent
logical errors. Peer testing will improve UI clarity and labeling. Error cases like no
recommendations and finished degree are handled gracefully to ensure user friendliness. Clean,
commented code. Tested with synthetic data only. Real-world testing is left for future phases.
4.10 Physical Environment
IAAS will operate in a typical academic computing environment. IAAS is made to run on normal
university computers or laptops. There will be no special hardware needed, and the users can

access it through a browser, often in a lab or classroom. It is also designed to display clearly on
projectors and standard screens, and will need a stable network
4.11 Security Issues
The admins will log in with a username and password, and the admin pages will be protected.
Even synthetic data is handled carefully. Users will only be able to see relevant records. All
communications use HTTPS where possible, and the admin passwords are securely hashed.
The admin sessions will expire automatically after certain time of inactivity. The chatbot is
limited to the course data and blocked from giving unrelated or unsafe answers.
4.12 Resource Issues
The complete software stack includes Python 3.9+ for backend logic and API development,
FastAPI framework for REST endpoint implementation, SQLite database for data persistence,
SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API for natural language
processing (with $20/month budget allocation), HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for frontend
development, D3.js library for interactive visualizations, bcrypt for secure password hashing, and
Git for version control. The system includes server-side usage logs and a simple quota meter
showing current/monthly spend and percentage of cap. Logs can be exported for review.
Development tools include Visual Studio Code or PyCharm IDE, Postman for API testing, and
Docker for containerization.

5. System Models
5.1 Scenarios/User Stories
Story 1: Course Recommendation Request
As a student, I want personalized course recommendations for next semester, so that I can
register for appropriate courses that align with my degree progress and academic standing.
Context: Alia is a third-year Software Engineering student who has completed 60% of her degree
requirements. She struggles with mathematics courses and prefers project-based learning. She
needs to select 4-5 courses for the upcoming semester.
Preconditions: Student record exists in the system; dataset loaded. Course catalog for the
upcoming semester is loaded. LLM service is operational.
Trigger: Alia opens IAAS and accesses the Chat Advisor interface.
Main Flow: (1) Alia types "What courses should I take next semester?" (2) System loads Alia’s
academic profile from dataset. (3) LLM analyzes profile: completed courses and remaining
requirements. (4) System generates initial recommendations based on degree requirements. (5)

Prerequisite validation confirms all suggested courses are eligible. (6) System returns 4-5 courses
with explanations. (7) Alia asks follow-up questions as needed.
Alternative Flows: If no eligible required courses remain, system suggests electives. If LLM
service fails, rule-based system activates within 3 seconds. If prerequisites not met, system
explains requirements needed first.
Acceptance Criteria: Recommendations include only courses with satisfied prerequisites.
Response median ≤2s, p95 ≤3.5s under normal load. Each recommendation includes justification
referencing degree requirements.
Outcome: Student receives an actionable plan and can request “why” or alternatives.
Postconditions: Interaction logged, and the progress dashboard remains consistent.

Story 2: Administrator Dataset Update
As an administrator, I want to upload an updated course catalog with new prerequisites, so that
the system reflects current curriculum changes.
Context: The Software Engineering program has revised prerequisites for several courses and
added two new electives for the upcoming academic year.
Preconditions: Admin authenticated and an active dataset version is set.
Trigger: Open Admin Data and click “Upload dataset”.

Main Flow: (1) Admin logs into the administrative portal with credentials. (2) Admin selects
"Upload Dataset" and chooses prepared CSV files. (3) System validates file format and schema
compliance. (4) System checks referential integrity. (5) System generates validation report. (6)
Admin reviews and confirms upload. (7) System activates new dataset version. (8) Confirmation
message displays with timestamp and version number.
Alternatives flows: Validation failures then it will reject the upload and provide a report. Partial
logical issues then it will skip bad rows and warn. LLM unavailable then it will show error
message.

Acceptance Criteria: Upload completes within 60 seconds for standard dataset. Validation report
identifies all issues before activation. Previous version remains accessible for rollback.
Outcome: System runs with the new catalog immediately.

Postconditions: Action logged, and prior version remains restorable.
