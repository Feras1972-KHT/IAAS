1. Introduction and Background
1.1 Problem Statement
Academic Advising plays a very important role in a student’s career, but still most universities
still rely on physical and manual methods that cant keep up with the growing number of
enrollments, as a result, many students cant get access to vital and important academic
advising that can shift a students studying career
Students sometimes get mixed advice or even face delays in graduating. Usually, this happens
because there just aren’t enough advisors to go around, especially during busy registration
times. Sometimes students have to wait a long time, and the advice they get can depend a lot
on which advisor they talk to. In our experience, existing online systems don’t really solve these
problems. They mostly help with signing up for classes, but they don’t offer smart academic
advice or help with planning and checking if a student’s choices actually make sense.
Without something smarter in place, we noticed students often feel lost when it comes to
planning their courses, and advisors get bogged down doing the same simple tasks over and
over, tasks that could probably be automated.
There is a need for an automated system that can check prerequisites, monitor academic
progress, help students create personalized study plans, and provide accessible guidance.This
will help students decide more confidently and ease the advisors of repetitive tasks

1.2 Motivation and Rationale
IAAS was created because academic programs are getting more complicated, and students
expect clear, efficient, and personalized advising. Students can get easily confused about their
decisions with the lack of resources and time

At first, traditional advising was thought to be enough, but with the increase of students and
courses, it became clear that short fast meetings, different opinions, and conflict of time can
slow students down. This issue is clear and seen by many universities, but automated tools
have not been really implemented. Digital advising can give students quick and accurate
answers, but most implemented tools don't check prerequisites, so even with a semi automated
system, students would still need to figure it out on their own
IAAS addresses these gaps by integrating intelligent automation into its advisory services.
Features such as automated prerequisite validation, degree progress visualization, semester
planning algorithms, and an AI-powered Chat Advisor provide students with accurate, consistent

guidance at any time, and with a structured rule-based logic it will ensure precise interpretation
of academic policies, reducing errors and promoting fairness.
IAAS automates repetitive tasks,such as checking course eligibility, validating combinations and
getting rid of conflicts, and interpreting program requirements, and reducing administrative tasks
for advisors. This enables greater focus on individualized support, improved operational
efficiency, and enhanced student experience.

1.3 Objectives
IAAS is designed to give students a smart, easy-to-use platform that makes planning and
academic advising simpler and more reliable. The main goals cover what the system should do,
how it should work technically, and how it helps the university overall.
1. Core Functional Objectives
Build a chat-based AI advisor that understands students’ questions about things like degree
requirements, prerequisites, course options, and academic rules, and gives them quick, helpful
answers.
Create an automated semester planner that suggests study plans for students, taking into
account the courses they’ve finished, their current status, and all the requirements for their
program.
Add a dashboard that shows which courses are done, which are ongoing, and which are left, so
students can see exactly where they stand on their path to graduation.
Set up a rule-based checker that checks if students meet all prerequisites before signing up for
classes, which will help them avoid scheduling errors.
Design a recommendation tool that suggests the best courses each semester, based on whats
available for students, how much they want to take on, and their overall degree plan.
Provide an admin portal where academic staff can easily upload, edit, and manage course data
and program details.

2. Technical and Engineering Objectives
Build the system with a modular, layered design, so that everything is separate. This makes it
easier to keep things running smoothly as the system grows.

Include a structured rule checker that can handle prerequisite rules, and course pathways,
using reliable data.
Make sure the system is easy to use, with a simple interface so students can find what they
need without much training.
Add secure login features so students and admins have different access levels, keeping all
academic data safe.
3. User Experience and Institutional Objectives
To reduce reliance on physical advisors by providing students with accurate, real-time academic
support.
To Improve advising efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.
To Support the university’s digital goals by offering a scalable advising tool.
To Enhance student satisfaction and success by empowering students to make informed
academic decisions.

1.4 Scope and Constraints
The scope of IAAS defines the boundaries of the Capstone I project, specifying deliverables and
limitations. IAAS is intended as a platform that helps students understand degree requirements,
plan semesters, track progress, and receive intelligent guidance. In Capstone I, the focus is on
requirements analysis.

Project Scope:
The IAAS project includes the following major components:
1. Student-Facing Features
Interactive Chat Advisor:
A text-based intelligent agent designed to answer academic questions related to prerequisites,
program requirements, registration rules, degree progress, and course information.
Degree Progress Dashboard:
A visual Diagram of the student’s completed, in-progress, and remaining courses, based on
their degree plan.

Automated Semester Planner:
A planning tool that suggests possible semester schedules by analyzing prerequisites,
remaining requirements, and course requisites.
Course Recommendation Suggestions:
A guided recommendation system that highlights possible courses for upcoming terms based on
the student's academic history and eligibility.
2. Admin and Backend Features
Dataset Management Interface:
Tools that allow administrators to upload course data, curriculum structures, prerequisite rules,
and program requirements.
Rule-Based Prerequisite Engine:
A backend module responsible for validating course eligibility and program logic.
User Authentication System:
Support for secure login, distinguishing student users from administrative users.
3. Engineering and Development Scope
Creation of the system’s requirements specification, including functional and non-functional
requirements.
Development of UML diagrams, including use case diagrams, ERD, sequence diagrams, activity
diagrams, and component diagrams.
Establishment of a modular layered architecture, separating frontend, backend, business logic,
and data layers.
Constraints
The IAAS project is subject to several constraints that influence development progress during
Capstone I:
1. No Direct Integration With University Systems
The system does not connect to Alfaisal University’s Banner or internal databases. All data must
be manually collected, cleaned, and uploaded, limiting real-time academic interactions.
2. Limited Dataset Availability
Course catalogs, prerequisite maps, and program structures must be manually prepared.
Incomplete or inconsistent datasets may limit the system's accuracy during the early stages.

3. Time Constraints
Capstone I focuses primarily on design, analysis.. Full system development is planned for
Capstone II.
4. Specification-Level Functionality
Due to time and resource limitations, only core system components such as the planner logic,
chatbot prototype, and prerequisite engine will be planned and implemented during Capstone II.
5. No Machine Learning in Capstone I
IAAS primarily relies on rule-based logic due to time and data constraints.
6. Team Size and Division of Responsibilities
With a small development team, multiple tasks such as dataset creation, UI design, backend
modeling, and documentation must be distributed carefully.

1.5 Project Overview
(IAAS) is a platform designed to automate a students course enrollment process. It brings
together automated reasoning, guidance tools, and data to help students understand their
degrees, plan their semesters, and avoid common errors that can be overlooked by physical
advisors, IAAS functions as an intelligent system, that brings together different modules to
support students across all years.
IAAS is built as a layered architecture that separates the system into several components,
Presentation Layer, which contains the interfaces both students and admins see, the Application
Layer, Which handles requests between frontend and backend to ensure smoothness and
efficient execution. Logic Layer, which contains prerequisite validation, rule interpretation, and
planning algorithms, The data layer, stores the datasets that contain course info, prerequisite
structures, and degree plans.
One of the central features of IAAS is the AI-powered Chat Advisor, which acts as an interactive
interface, enabling students to ask questions about courses, program requirements, graduation
timelines, and general academic concerns. Through rule-based logic and structured datasets,
the Chat Advisor provides instant, consistent, and accurate responses, which eliminates the
need for students to rely on advisor availability and provides 24/7 academic support.

Another core component is the Degree Progress Dashboard, which represents a student’s
academic status. The dashboard allows students to view completed, ongoing, and remaining
courses in their degree plan. This visual clarity helps students understand how far they have
come and what requirements remain. It also serves as a foundation for generating personalized
academic recommendations.
The Automated Semester Planner is a tool that helps students build semester schedules. The
planner checks prerequisite conditions, remaining degree requirements, course corequisites,
and typical academic sequencing patterns to generate course combinations. This ensures that
students select courses in an order that aligns with academic rules based on the semester and
long-term success.
Additionally, IAAS includes a Rule-Based Prerequisite Checker that checks the program's
academic structure and verifies whether students meet the required conditions before enrolling
in any course. This feature directly addresses one of the most common student mistakes,
enrolling in courses without the proper background, which leads to administrative withdrawals,
academic delays, or unnecessary difficulties.
The Admin Portal allows authorized academic staff to upload, update, and manage curriculum
data, prerequisite rules, and degree structures. This ensures the system remains accurate and
up to date with program changes. The portal provides tools for maintaining academic rules
without requiring programming knowledge.
During Capstone I, the IAAS project focused entirely on the foundational planning and design
stages. Our work during this phase involved identifying system requirements, defining the
architecture, outlining the user interface layout, and detailing how the core components should
function. No actual implementation or coding of these components has been completed at this
stage. Instead, Capstone I served to establish a clear blueprint for how these modules will be
built in Capstone II.
Overall, the IAAS project aims to combine automation, intelligent academic reasoning, and
user-centered design to create a system that supports student success, reduces advisor
workloads, and contributes to the university’s digital transformation goals. By integrating multiple
tools into a single unified platform, IAAS offers a structured, accurate, and efficient approach to
academic planning and advising—ultimately helping students progress through their degrees
with clarity, confidence, and reduced risk of academic setbacks.

2. Related Work
Academic advising systems have evolved in recent years as universities seek to improve
student support, reduce administrative challenges, and make degree planning easier. Several
digital degree-auditing and planning tools are available on the market, such as Ellucian

DegreeWorks, Stellic, uAchieve, and various advising platforms. These tools provide structured
support for tracking academic progress, but they differ in automation capabilities, user
interactivity, flexibility, and reliance on human advisors. This section examines existing solutions,
identifies their strengths and limitations, and highlights the gaps that the Intelligent Academic
Advisory System (IAAS) aims to address.

2.3 Summary of Gaps in Existing Systems
Across all reviewed solutions, three major gaps consistently appear:
1. Lack of Intelligent Reasoning
Most systems check degree requirements, but they do not provide real-time academic advising
or answer complex student queries. IAAS fills this gap with a chat-based advising interface,
powered by structured rules.
2. Limited Personalization
Existing tools rely heavily on static curriculum structures. IAAS introduces dynamic planning,
adjusting course suggestions based on, prerequisites, current progress, program variations and
student load preferences

3. High Integration Dependence
Major commercial systems require deep integration with SIS (student information system). IAAS
is designed to operate independently, allowing, rapid prototyping, controlled data testing,
minimal deployment overhead

2.4 Contribution of IAAS Compared to Prior Work
IAAS differentiates itself through the following:
1. Unified Advising
IAAS integrates degree progress tracking, planning, and a chat-based advising assistant into a
single platform.
2. Rule-Based Academic Intelligence
Unlike traditional advising tools, IAAS interprets academic rules, enabling prerequisite checks,
course eligibility checks, and validation of student choices
3. Academic Support
IAAS includes an interactive advising chatbot capable of real-time responses, which existing
commercial tools do not provide.
4. Modular Architecture
IAAS is built using a layered architecture, which is easy to expand, update, and migrate into a
full-scale deployment.

2.5 Conclusion of Related Work
It turns out that existing advising systems are effective in certain cases, but often lack intelligent
reasoning, personalization, and flexibility. IAAS is designed to fill these gaps by offering an
integrated, intelligent, academic advising tool with advanced planning capabilities.

3. System Requirements Specification (SRS Summary)

3.1 Overview of Proposed System
IAAS was made with the idea in mind to support students and help them understand the
requirements they need to meet and to make decisions that are right throughout their career.
The system joins several tools to help ease the academic life of a student, those tools would
track their progress, check if they are eligible for a course, explore any other remaining
requirements the student has not yet met, and plan early on for upcoming semesters
IAAS serves two main roles: students and administrators. Students interact with the system as
they see fit and needed, either they view their progress, or check the eligibility for a course, or
chat with the built in chat advisor. Administrators on the other hand, they are responsible for
managing the datasets through an interface deigned for them, they can update courses,
prerequisites and program requirements to make sure the system reflects current academic
information.
The system focuses on delivering accurate and accessible advising support by organizing
academic data in a structured way and presenting it through tools designed to help students
navigate their degree requirements. This overview outlines the core purpose, users, and
expected capabilities of IAAS at a high level, serving as a foundation for the functional and
non-functional requirements described in the rest of this section.

3.3 Non-Functional Requirements Summary
The non-functional requirements for the Intelligent Academic Advisory System (IAAS) describe
the quality expectations that guide how the system should operate and how users should
experience it, they play an important role in shaping the system’s performance, reliability, ease
of use, and long-term sustainability. Identifying these attributes this early helps ensure that the
final implementation will meet both technical standards and user expectations.
One of the most important non-functional requirements for IAAS is performance. The system is
expected to respond to common advising tasks, such as checking course eligibility, retrieving
degree progress, or answering questions within a short time frame, ideally under two seconds.
Students will rely on IAAS for quick academic decisions, so delays or slow responses could
negatively affect the usability of the platform. In addition to response speed, the system should
be able to support many users accessing it at the same time, especially during peak advising or
registration periods.
Reliability is another major requirement. IAAS needs to consistently return accurate information
about prerequisites, degree requirements, and course availability. Because mistakes in advising
can heavily influence academic progress, the system must handle rule evaluations and data
retrieval with high accuracy. Any errors in the dataset or rule definitions should be caught and
flagged for administrators before they affect students. The platform should also be resilient
enough to recover from unexpected failures or invalid data inputs without crashing or producing
misleading results.
The system must also take care of security and privacy, since it may eventually work with
sensitive academic information such as student records, completed courses, and program
progress. While the Capstone I prototype uses test data, the full system should enforce user
authentication and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized administrators can
modify academic rules or datasets. Student accounts should be protected with secure password
storage, and communication between the frontend and backend should follow secure protocols.
Another key requirement is usability. IAAS is intended to assist students who may not be familiar
with academic terminology or complex degree structures. For this reason, the interface must be
simple, readable, and easy to navigate. The Chat Advisor should provide clear explanations,
and the degree progress dashboard should present information in a way that helps students
quickly understand where they stand. The Admin Panel should also be designed with ease of

use in mind so that advisors and staff can update academic data without needing technical
expertise.
Scalability is also an important consideration. As the university offers new degree programs or
updates existing ones, the system should be able to grow without needing major architectural
changes. The rule engine and data structures should be flexible enough to support additional
courses, prerequisites, and program requirements. Future enhancements, such as
machine-learning-based recommendations or real-time integration with the university
information system, should fit naturally into the architecture.
Finally, maintainability is a key non-functional requirement. Because academic rules and
program structures change over time, the system must be easy to update. Good documentation,
clean module design, and separation of concerns will make it easier for future developers to
update system components without risking other parts of the system.
Together, these non-functional requirements ensure that IAAS is not only functional but also
high-quality, dependable, secure, and user-friendly. They provide a framework that guides the
development of the system in Capstone II and help guarantee that IAAS will be a reliable tool for
students and advisors once it is fully implemented.

4. System Design and Architecture

4.1 the Architectural Style
The Intelligent Academic Advisory System (IAAS) is based on a Layered Architecture Style, this
architecture organizes the system into separate layers, each responsible for a specific set of
functions.
The layered architecture of IAAS is composed of four primary layers:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Presentation Layer
Application Layer
Domain Logic Layer
Data Layer

1. Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer is responsible for all interactions between the system and its users, It
includes the web-based dashboards, forms, planning tools, chatbot interface, and admin
management pages. This layer focuses on user experience design, accessibility, and the
presentation of information in an easy-to-navigate format.
Responsibilities include:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Displaying degree progress dashboards
Providing interfaces for semester planning
Managing chat interactions through the Chat Advisor
Allowing admins to upload and edit academic datasets

The Presentation Layer communicates exclusively with the Application Layer, ensuring that all
business logic remains separated from UI components.
2. Application Layer
The Application Layer acts as the intermediary between the user interface and the internal
system logic. It manages data flow, controls system processes, and handles incoming requests
from the Presentation Layer. This layer contains controllers, request handlers, and service
modules that executes the operations across the system.
Responsibilities include:
●​ Handling student and admin requests
●​ Routing queries to the appropriate domain logic components
●​ Managing authentication and session control
●​ Serving RESTful API endpoints to the frontend
●​ Coordinating interactions between modules
By centralizing these operations, the Application Layer ensures a consistent, controlled
interaction with lower system layers.
3. Domain Logic Layer
The Domain Logic Layer contains the core of IAAS and performs all rule-based and
computational operations. It is the most critical component of the architecture, as it structures
how academic data is interpreted and how decisions are made.
Responsibilities include:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Executing prerequisite validation logic
Interpreting academic rules and program structures
Generating automated semester plans
Running course recommendation logic

●​ Producing Chat Advisor responses based on academic rules
●​ Handling degree progress calculations
This layer ensures that all academic reasoning within IAAS is centralized, consistent, and
independent of both the user interface and data storage mechanisms.
4. Data Layer (Database and Storage Layer)
The Data Layer is responsible for all long-term storage and retrieval of academic data. It
includes the system’s databases, structured datasets, files, and data access interfaces.
Responsibilities include:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

Storing course catalogs
Maintaining prerequisite maps
Managing degree requirements and program structures
Holding student academic profiles
Ensuring data integrity and consistency
Providing secure access to stored information

Data in this layer is accessed exclusively through the Domain Logic Layer or repository
interfaces, ensuring controlled and consistent data usage throughout the system.

4.2 UML Component Diagram

4.3 Key Design Decisions and Rationale
One of the main key decisions was implementing the layered architecture, this was chosen to
isolate each major component so that everything looks neat and can be changed or updated
without configuring the whole system
Another key decision was to implement a rule based engine to validate prerequisites, academic
programs must adhere to to strict policies that change semester to semester and from each
doctor, if we hardcode this into the system then updating it per semester would be time costly
and repetitive, this gives admins the free will to update the system regularly with the change of
policies or course timings or program prerequisites.
Another key decision was to design each core advisory function as independent components.
Treating these modules as standalone subsystems makes the IAAS platform more modular and
scalable. Each component can be expanded or replaced in the future without disrupting the rest
of the system.
From a user experience standpoint, the team decided to implement IAAS as a web-based
system accessible from standard browsers. This decision was chosen because of the diverse
needs of students and administrators, who require immediate access to academic tools without
installing specific applications. A web interface simplifies deployment and testing and ensures
that the system remains accessible across devices and platforms
Data organization was another key design consideration. Academic Data such as course
information, prerequisites, program structures, and student records, needed to be stored in
structured and easily maintainable formats. The team chose to design the data layer to support
both relational databases and structured files,ensuring flexibility during early development and
scalability in future phases.
We chose to use RESTful APIs to manage communication between the user interface and
backend logic. It ensures that interactions between system layers remain consistent and
organized, allowing the frontend, backend, and data layers to evolve independently.
Security considerations also played a vital role in the system’s design. IAAS handles sensitive
academic information, so implementing clear role separation between students and
administrators was essential. The system was designed with access control mechanisms that
prevent unauthorized modifications to datasets or program rules. Although full security
specification and implementation will occur in Capstone II, establishing these design principles
early ensures that the system remains aligned with university policies and data protection
expectations.

4.4 Deployment View

4.5 Boundary Conditions
IAAS must establish all of the core components during initialization. The first step is to load the
academic data stored to the memory, for example course lists and prerequisites, then the
system prepares the main modules like the rule engine and the planner so they are ready to
handle requests, and finally the system establishes a connection with the database and start the
service required for users to log in, when all this is completed then the system is ready to use
In the termination phase, the system will close all active sessions and disconnect safely from
the database to prevent data loss, and it saves logs or records to help with future debugging.
After all this the system shuts down fully
Failure handling ensures that the system will respond in a a safe and predictable way, for
example if a dataset is missing. The system should notify the admin instead of trying to give
incorrect answers or results, or if a student enters an unsupported request, the system should
return a simple message rather than overdo it and crash the whole system.

In summary, the boundary conditions of IAAS ensure that the system behaves predictably and
safely during startup, shutdown, and unexpected failures. By defining clear initialization routines,
controlled termination procedures, and robust failure-handling strategies, Our System maintains
reliability and protects academic integrity.

6. Project Management Overview

6.1 Work Breakdown and Roles
Feras Alkahtani focused on the conceptual planning of the backend and the structure of the
system. His work included helping outline how the core advising components should function,
such as the rule engine and the overall academic logic that the system will eventually use. He
also contributed heavily to writing and refining different parts of the documentation, especially
the requirements and design sections. His role centered on shaping how these components
should behave once development begins in Capstone II.

Abdulaziz Albaz worked on defining the direction of the user interface and the general user
experience. He sketched early versions of the main screens, and was heavily involved in all the
diagram drawings. He also participated in writing and reviewing several parts of the report and
helped ensure the UI concepts matched the system’s goals.
Mohammed Alhajri concentrated on organizing the academic data structure and supporting the
development of the requirements. He worked on outlining how course information, prerequisites,
and degree requirements should be arranged for future implementation. He also helped prepare

the functional and non-functional requirements, contributed to the use case descriptions, and
participated in documenting the overall system behavior.
Because our team is small, many tasks were shared between all members, and a lot of the work
was done together. We often worked together on the requirements, the diagrams, and the
system design discussions, making decisions as a group and helping each other refine ideas.
Capstone I was mainly focused on planning and documentation rather than implementation, so
most of the work involved conceptual development and preparing a clear foundation for the next
phase.

6.2 Ethical and Professional Considerations
The team approached the design of the system with a strong emphasis on correctness and
accountability, because any automated advising system has the potential to influence a
student’s academic trajectory, making reliability and accuracy ethical obligations rather than
merely technical requirements.
Another critical ethical consideration involves data privacy and confidentiality. IAAS uses
academic datasets, student progress information, and program structure files that must be
handled with strict confidentiality. Even though the Capstone I conceptual model uses test or
manually prepared data rather than live student records, the design decisions anticipate
real-world deployment conditions. Access control mechanisms were considered from an early
stage to ensure that student data remains private and that only authorized users can modify
curriculum files or prerequisite rules.
Through past experiences we realized that traditional advising can sometimes be affected by
inconsistencies or differences in interpretation among advisors. IAAS aims to provide unbiased
advising that treats all students equally, but the team keeps in mind that automated systems
may overlook exceptional or personal cases, that's why IAAS is a supporting tool to the advisors
not something to take over traditional advising fully. Its purpose is to reduce the workload and
provide students with immediate support while still allowing academic staff to review personal or
unusual cases. This model ensures fairness without removing the personalized human element
needed in certain academic situations.
Finally, professional responsibility is must, it is a students right to know why the system dictates
whether course A is a right or wrong course, this is why explanations would be needed to help
students understand the systems point of view, and that at the end of the day it is a system
designed to give the most optimal answer and has a lack of emotion, but at the end of the day
the system must be rational about its advising decisions.

7. Conclusion and Final Work

During Capstone I, our goal was to understand what IAAS should do and plan how it should
work once we begin. In this semester we focused on gathering requirements, studying the
advising process, and designing the main parts of the system. Although no functional
components have been built, we were able to create a clear picture of how the system should
behave and what users will interact with.
This project taught us the importance of planning before coding, and of the dangers of not
minimizing the scope. We learnt how to break down the system into several smaller components
and begin working on it from scratch rather than seeing the whole picture, we also learned the
value of working as a team and with a small team we did not take our numbers for granted.
In Capstone II, our focus will be on building what we specified in Capstone I, we also intend to
uphold the design decisions and planning established in Capstone I and shift them into a
working system during Capstone II. We will implement the backend, develop the UI, connect
datasets and make the advising system functional, we also plan to test each feature to make
sure it corresponds with the level of quality we seek. By the end of Capstone II, we will have a
working version of the IAAS that users can use for real advising tasks.
