# Intelligent Academic Advisory System (IAAS)

## Overview
The Intelligent Academic Advisory System (IAAS) is a software system designed to support university students in academic decision-making.  
It assists with course planning, degree progress tracking, and advisory recommendations based on predefined rules and structured academic data.

This project was developed as a senior capstone in Software Engineering.

## Problem Statement
Academic advising is often manual, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.  
Students struggle to understand degree requirements, prerequisites, and optimal course sequencing, which leads to delayed graduation and poor academic decisions.

IAAS addresses this by formalizing advising logic into a centralized system.

## Core Features
- Degree requirement evaluation  
- Course eligibility and prerequisite checking  
- Academic progress tracking  
- Rule-based advisory recommendations  
- Structured student and curriculum data handling  

## System Architecture
- Backend handles business logic and advisory rules  
- Database stores students, courses, prerequisites, and degree plans  
- Frontend provides an interface for interacting with advisory outputs  

Architecture is designed for clarity, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python  
- Frontend: Web-based interface  
- Database: Relational database  
- Architecture: Layered / modular design  

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required dependencies  
3. Configure environment variables (if applicable)  
4. Initialize the database  
5. Run the backend server  
6. Access the frontend interface  

Detailed setup steps may vary depending on deployment environment.
